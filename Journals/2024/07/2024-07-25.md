# Journal Entry for 2024-07-25

## How do you feel today?
- I feel ok. Had a little bit of frustration with understanding why some code decisions were made, but we're learning and working through it.

## What did I do today?
- Tested PY-6829 (bug around forms being added to a review cycle with the Employee Manager as author)
    - Talked with Lucy for a bit about it
- Tested PY-6800 (bug displaying Review Cycle when replacing "Other Employee" placeholder with a real employee)
- Tested PY-6844 (unable to add subjects to an existing review cycle in sandbox)
- Couple of PR reviews
- Grooming

## What am I doing tomorrow?
- Pick up next ticket in the backlog

## Any blockers?
- No

## What did I learn today?
- The review feature set is complicated.
- Using `null` as a signal to use a different value should be considered an anti-pattern. Use the value straight up.
- Things that are obvious to me are not always obvious to others. I need to keep this in mind more.
